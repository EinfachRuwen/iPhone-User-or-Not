  <h1>About the Game</h1>
  <p>
    The game "Is it an iPhone-User or not?" is a fun guessing game where you need to guess whether a person in a given picture is an iPhone user or not. You will be presented with a series of user profiles, and your task is to select the correct answer based on the visual clues provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    To play the game, choose a group and a game mode. In the normal mode, you will have multiple chances to guess correctly, while in the one life mode, you only have one chance to guess correctly. The game will keep track of your score and display it at the end.
